Harry Potter is an ordinary boy living with his unkind aunt and uncle until he discovers he's actually a wizard. On his eleventh
birthday, he gets invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he meets new friends like Ron and Hermione. 
 
 At school, Harry learns about magic, plays a sport called Quidditch, and uncovers secrets about his past. He also finds out about a
 
 dark wizard named Voldemort, who is trying to return to power. Throughout his adventures, Harry must face challenges and danger, 
  
 but he always fights to protect his friends and the magical world.
